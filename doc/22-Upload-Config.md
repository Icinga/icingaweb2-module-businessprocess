# Upload a Configuration File

You can upload a formerly downloaded or even a manually created file directly
through the web frontend. Given sufficient permissions, the Dashboard provides
a related link:

## Chose a file

This can be any file:

It should be valid of course, but don't worry - Icinga Business Process Modeling
protects you from syntax errors:

Just for fun you could try to upload an image or whatever you want - it will not
break. It will also protect you from accidentally overwriting existing files:

So in case you need to replace an existing process, please delete it before
uploading a new one.
